# zoo-frontend

This is dirty frontend, i made this just to show approximetly how i would make it.

Things to imporve.
1) Create directive( for overlaping code ) - DRY
2) Create loading directive - To not show code when ajax is still loading - UI
3) Make Partials for form views( html ) - DRY
4) No tests - I would use KARMA

Also code could be cleaner.


You must install gulp, bower - easyst way to do npm
To start server gulp serve

Have fun reviewer! :)
